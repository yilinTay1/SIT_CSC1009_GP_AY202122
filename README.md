Intended Learning Outcome (ILO):
1. Appreciate the beauty of CLI application
2. Apply the Java knowledge into the application
3. Experience Internet of Things (IoT), file input/output (I/O), and socket programming 
(optional)
4. Experiment the software architecture design principle

Tasks:
By the end of the project, you should
1. Implement an ATM CLI application, with the listed fundamental features below,
2. Brainstorm advanced features with creative ideas,
3. Apply the course contents (e.g. abstract, interface, IoT HTTP call, etc) to the project,
4. Show the necessary best practice in Java, and general coding principle,

Fundamental Features:
1. Account Information (e.g. how many accounts, account numbers, etc)
2. Balance Check (e.g. remain balance, available balance, etc)
3. Authentication (e.g. password check / reset, etc)
4. Money Transfer(e.g. inter-account transfer, third-party transfer, etc)
5. Settings (e.g. transfer limit, overseas withdraw limit, etc)

Sample Data & Suggested Features:
1. Bank transaction records: refer to the bank_sample.csv (version number may be 
different), there are over 100k records for your development use. Serve this as a 
sample only and you can develop, extend your own system design. Computer is not 
that reliable if programmer do not handle the procedure well. You may find these 
records "interesting" as your instructor is not that nice to give you a straight forward 
dataset.
2. Exceptions: you learnt exceptions in the class, so you are going to implement this 
techniques in your project. What kind of exceptions you are going to catch? How will 
you handle when exceptions are caught? Discuss with your team as there are more 
than one possible solutions. (Hints: link in to bank transaction records)
3. IoT: this is another topic you learnt in the class. The basic most input and output 
operation require your manipulation towards a data file stored in the hard drive. Next, 
can you make certain HTTP Restful call to make your system advance? And how about 
socket programming? (Hints: apart from file I/O, HTTP and Socket call are considered 
advanced features. You may wish to take a look in the challenge questions)
Instructor: Peter YAU 3
4. Unit Testing: apart from catching all the foreseeable exceptions, unit testing is 
something a programmer can do before production, to ensure how your output is as 
robust as possible. Do enough unit testing (good for your examination, too) to gain 
extra credits in the project.
