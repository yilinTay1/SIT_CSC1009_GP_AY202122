Apply the Java knowledge into the application 3. Experience Internet of Things (IoT), file input/output (I/O), and socket programming  (optional) 4. Experiment the software architecture design principle Tasks: By the end of the project, you should 1. Implement an ATM CLI application, with the listed fundamental features below, 2. Brainstorm advanced features with creative ideas, 3. Apply the course contents (e.g. abstract, interface, IoT HTTP call, etc) to the project, 4. Show the necessary best practice in Java, and general coding principle,
